        <h1 class="WheelSectionHeader">About Me</h1>
        <p class="WheelSectionParagraph">I am a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science and Music Technology through the BCSA program. I have been deeply invested in music composition and music technology from a young age and love exploring ideas in computer science and math, especially from the perspective of the abstraction of music. I also love to teach and have experience tutoring, working for Mathnasium, and TAing. In addition to my pursuits in music and CS, I am interested in langauge and have been studying Spanish and Mandarin Chinese.<p>

      <section class="two">
        <h1 class="WheelSectionHeader">Music Background</h1>
        <p class="WheelSectionParagraph">I enjoy playing improvisational piano and using the piano as a compositional tool. I also love playing snare drum and have enjoyed playing in the CMU pipes and drums band. I started producing electronic music in 7th grade using Ableton Live (one of my favorite pieces of software). I also love Kontakt and Serum. In addition to my exploration of electronic music and music technology, I have written acoustic pieces, particularly for piano, and piano and flute. Musically I am inspired by Anomalie, KOAN Sound, Jacob Collier, and others. Ultimeatly I am looking towards developing a tool for research for developing new music theory which is applicable to today's music and for composition.<p>

      <section class="three">
        <h1 class="WheelSectionHeader">CS/Math Background</h1>
        <p class="WheelSectionParagraph">I have experience working on projects in python, C, C++, and Standard ML. I love studying the more theoretical aspects of CS at CMU including complexity analysis, context free grammars and parsers, proofs of correctness, and more. As I love thinking about these things, I have also studied quite a bit of math: I have experience with proof based multidimensional calculus and linear algebra and plan on studying digital signal processing deeply. Just like how Standard ML allows for the user to easily achieve the most desirable level of abstraction while writing code, I want to use my technical skills to create a tool that allows composers to easily achieve the most desirable level of abstraction while writing music.<p>
