How this works:

1) !! this is not really step 1
 - index.html references src/dist/main.js, which is generated by webpack 
 - generate src/dist/main.js with webpack by running `npx webpack --config webpack.config.cjs' from /src (but this is actually step 5)
 
2)
  webpack has a main entry point in src/index.js, which includes Monaco and sets it up with the MotorMusic language 

3) 
 The language is first defined in antlr in the antlr folder. From src/antlr, ` /Users/zacksussman/Library/Python/3.9/bin/antlr4 -Dlanguage=TypeScript MotorMusicParser.g4 MotorMusicLexer.g4 -o generated' to generate 
 typescript files for the lexer and parser in src/antlr/generated

4) 
 This typescript code can be accessed from within the main application from the code exported in src/main/typescript, which defines AccessParser.ts
 We define a typescript configuration in src/main/tsconfig.json, which specifies to compile src/typescript into the folder generated-javascript. 
  Run tsc from src/main to carry this out, which ensures that src/main/generated-javascript has code for AccessParser.js as well as javascript versions 
  of the generated parser code from antlr. 

5) Now you are ready for step 1)



OR JUST RUN THE MAKEFILE!!
