        <h1 class="WheelSectionHeader">About Me</h1>
        <p class="WheelSectionParagraph" >I graduated Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science and Music Technology through the BCSA program. I have been deeply invested in music composition and music technology from a young age and love exploring ideas in computer science and mathematics. I also love to teach and have experience tutoring and TAing. In addition to my pursuits in music and CS, I am interested in language and have been studying Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. On the side, I enjoy recreational poker, card magic, speed cubing, and chess.<p>

      <section class="three">
        <h1 class="WheelSectionHeader">CS/Math Background</h1>
        <p class="WheelSectionParagraph">I have experience working on projects in Python, C, C++, Standard ML, Swift, JS, HTML/CSS, among other languages. I love studying the more theoretical aspects of CS at CMU including type theory, PL design, proofs, complexity theory, and probability theoroy. I love the problem solving that comes with mathematics and seeing how various topics within the subject interact with the real world. Whether it's using basic probability theory to make better poker decisions, seeing how continuous mathematics give rise to signal processing algorithms, or using math to formalize and prove computer science itself, I'm always excited to learn and do more!<p>
      </section>

      <section class="two">
        <h1 class="WheelSectionHeader">Music Background</h1>
        <p class="WheelSectionParagraph">I enjoy playing improvisational piano and using the piano as a compositional tool. I also love playing snare drum and have enjoyed playing in the CMU pipes and drums band. I started producing electronic music in 7th grade using Ableton Live (one of my favorite pieces of software). In addition to my exploration of electronic music and music technology, I have written acoustic pieces, particularly for piano, and piano and flute. Musically I am inspired by artists like Anomalie, KOAN Sound, Virtual Riot, Jacob Collier, Tigran Hamasyan, and others. Ultimately I am looking towards developing new music theory which is mathematically formalized, yet applicable to today's music. This could be related to algorithmic composition, but also could have implications in other fields. <p>
